## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components & Utilities

## üöÄ Installation

**üõë Important Warning:** These are my personal dotfiles. Running these scripts will **overwrite** your existing configurations. Always back up your important data and dotfiles before proceeding. I am not responsible for any data loss or system instability.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate into the directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yehorych13/dotfiles && cd dotfiles
```

### Step 2: Install the interactive Installer

The `install.sh` script is now an all-in-one interactive installer. It will handle everything from system dependencies to dotfile deployment.

Simply make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The script will guide you through the following process:
1. **Package installation**: It will first ask if you want to run the system package installer (`install_packages.sh`). This is highly recommended for a fresh setup to install all necessary applications, drivers, and an AUR helper.

2. **Dotfiles Deployment**: Next, it will prompt you to select which components to install (configs, themes, wallpapers). It will safely back up any of your existing configurations to `$HOME/.config_backup_$(date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")` before creating symbolic links.

### Step 3: Final Setup

A few final steps are needed to complete the installation.

1.  **Set Zsh as default shell:**
    ```bash
    chsh -s $(which zsh)
    ```
    *You will need to log out and log back in for this change to take effect.*

2.  **Reboot:**
    Once the scripts are finished, reboot your system to apply all changes and start your new Hyprland session.
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

## üé® Post-Installation & Customization

*   **Display Manager (Login Screen):** If you chose SDDM during installation, it is highly recommended to install the [sddm-astronaut-theme](https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme) to achieve a matching look.

*   **Wallpapers:** After logging in, launch `waypaper` to select and set your wallpaper. You can open it via the application menu (`SUPER + R`).

*   **Keyboard Remapping (Optional):** If you want to use my `kanata` configuration (which remaps `Caps Lock` to `Esc` on tap and `Ctrl` on hold), follow the setup guide [here](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/main/docs/setup-linux.md).

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings
